*   **Active Trials**: Number of trials currently in progress.
*   **Total Enrolled**: Total number of patients enrolled across all trials.
*   **Active Sites**: Number of clinical sites currently active.
*   **Data Quality**: Real-time metric of data integrity.
*   **Agent Status**: Quick status of your AI agent network.
